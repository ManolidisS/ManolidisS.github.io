    <div class="content"><p>My name is <b>Spyridon Manolidis</b>, and I'm otherwise known as Spyros (or ManolidisS online).
    <br>
    I was originally born in Greece, but now am proud to also call Wales my home.
    <br>
    I am currently 14 (almost 15), and have a really strong passion for <b>mathematics, physics, and computer science.</b>
    <br>
    I also play and really enjoy the violin!
    <br>
    As of writing this, I am almost halfway through my first GCSE year (Year 10). Things have certainly gotten more difficult, but I must admit I enjoy the challenge!
    <br>
    I aspire to one day change the world through my passions, primarily physics and maths, and I am on the hunt for <b>altruistic</b> opportunities which will allow me to develop and mature as a scientist.

    <h3>Academia and Extra-curriculars</h3>
    <p>By the time I finish year 11, I intend to have 13 <b>GCSEs</b>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mathematics</li>
      <li>Mathematics (Numeracy)</li>
      <li>Further Mathematics</li>
      <li>English Language</li>
      <li>English Literature</li>
      <li>Physics</li>
      <li>Chemistry</li>
      <li>Biology</li>
      <li>Welsh</li>
      <li>Religious Studies</li>
      <li>Computer Science</li>
      <li>Music</li>
      <li>Greek</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also try to involve myself in many extra-curriculars to explore and develop my different passions and hobbies.
    For example, in school I attend:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The school orchestra</li>
      <li>The school choir</li>
      <li>My year group's vocal ensemble, <em>Diatonics</em>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These commitments are crucial for the development of my social skills and teach me valuable lessons, such as the importance of teamwork and coordination.
      <br>
      I also try and keep myself busy outside of school by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Attending tutoring lessons in Physics/Maths which drastically helps to improve my intuition and introduces me to new, exciting problems.</li>
        <li>Taking violin (and music theory) lessons at a <b>grade 8</b> and grade 5 standard, respectively. This is not only one of my passions, but it links well with topics in physics and maths such as standing waves.</li>
        <li>Having lessons in Greek to maintain my proficiency in my mother tounge.</li>
        <li>Having lessons in German to learn a new language and open new opportunities.</li>
        <li>Taking karate lessons in my local karate club which teaches me discipline, focus, and the importance of practice!</li>
        <li>Attending CCVG's high schools' orchestra which makes me appreciate the incredible things we can do as a community, with each instrument playing their part!</li>
        <li>Having Byzantine Music lessons, which make me value my heritage and culture.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Lastly, it is worth mentioning that my school has chosen me to participate in the <a href="https://serenspace.wales/">Seren Academy</a>, an academy funded by the Welsh government for top pupils in public schools looking to get into higher education.</p>
    <p>I've added quite a lot of information here, but some more personal details have been omitted for my safety. If you have any queries, please don't hesitate to contact me <a href="mailto:queries@manolidis.me">here</a>.</p></div>

      <h3>My Future with Altruism</h3>
      <p>I feel like too many young people nowadays just search up "What are the best paying careers?" on the internet to find inspiration for a dream job.
      I've been a victim of this too - I regularly wonder whether my future is going to be fruitful and if I'll be able to be self-sufficient.
      But I feel like the world is becoming more and more money driven.
      Consumerism and the promotion of over-consumption are being forced down our throats not only in the products we buy, but now with our career options.
      More and more young people are being pressured to pursue competitive jobs just for their salaries.
      Is this what makes people happy? Is this what'll make me happy?</p>
      <p>I don't think so. Maybe it's because of my religon, or because of my morals, but I don't want a job just for the money.
      As I hope I have made it clear, I love love love STEM and particualrly physics and maths.
      Hence, I want to use my skills and talents to genuinely make a change in the world.
      That is why I have recently taken an interest in the altruistic community and I am on the lookout for altruistic opportunities.
      I have begun trying to apply to as many programmes as possible which will help me make a difference, even with my limited knowledge of physics and maths (compared to researchers).
      Therefore dear visitor, I kindly ask you that if you do have any opportunities for me, you can inform me <a href="mailto:opportunities@manolidis.me">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Of course, if I am to call myself an aspiring altruist, then I shouldn't just wait for selective programmes to accept me - I should be trying to make a difference in my local community.
      That is why when my school was presented with a fantastic initiative called <a href="https://firstgive.co.uk/">First Give</a>, my team and I worked tirelessly to support our chosen local charity (<a href="https://www.tenovuscancercare.org.uk/">Tenovus</a>).
      We created a petition, and even used our musical skills to create a song based on the charity's name called "Just the Tenovus."
      The judging panel commended our effort, and the program taught us invaluable skills of teamwork and the importance of caring for our local community.</p>
