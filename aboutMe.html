    <div class="content"><p>My name is <b>Spyridon Manolidis</b>, and I'm otherwise known as Spyros (or ManolidisS online).
    <br>
    I was originally born in Greece, but now am proud to also call Wales my home.
    <br>
    I am currently 14 (almost 15), and have a really strong passion for <b>mathematics, physics, and computer science.</b>
    <br>
    I also play and really enjoy the violin!
    <br>
    As of writing this, I am almost halfway through my first GCSE year (Year 10). Things have certainly gotten more difficult, but I must admit I enjoy the challenge!
    <br>
    I aspire to one day change the world through my passions, primarily physics and maths, and I am on the hunt for <b>altruistic</b> opportunities which will allow me to develop and mature as a scientist.
    </p></div>
    <br>
    <div class="content">
    <p>By the time I finish year 11, I intend to have 13 <b>GCSEs</b>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Mathematics</li>
      <li>Mathematics (Numeracy)</li>
      <li>Further Mathematics</li>
      <li>English Language</li>
      <li>English Literature</li>
      <li>Physics</li>
      <li>Chemistry</li>
      <li>Biology</li>
      <li>Welsh</li>
      <li>Religious Studies</li>
      <li>Computer Science</li>
      <li>Music</li>
      <li>Greek</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I also try to involve myself in many extra-curriculars to explore and develop my different passions and hobbies.
    For example, in school I attend:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The school orchestra</li>
      <li>The school choir</li>
      <li>My year group's vocal ensemble, <em>Diatonics</em>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These commitments are crucial for the development of my social skills and teach me valuable lessons, such as the importance of teamwork and coordination.
      <br>
      I also try and keep myself busy outside of school by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Attending tutoring lessons in Physics/Maths which drastically helps to improve my intuition and introduces me to new, exciting problems.</li>
        <li>Taking violin (and music theory) lessons at a <b>grade 8</b> and grade 5 standard, respectively. This is not only one of my passions, but it links well with topics in physics and maths such as standing waves.</li>
        <li>Having lessons in Greek to maintain my proficiency in my mother tounge.</li>
        <li>Having lessons in German to learn a new language and open new opportunities.</li>
        <li>Taking karate lessons in my local karate club which teaches me discipline, focus, and the importance of practice!</li>
        <li>Attending CCVG's high schools' orchestra which makes me appreciate the incredible things we can do as a community, with each instrument playing their part!</li>
        <li>Having Byzantine Music lessons, which make me value my heritage and culture.</li>
        <li>Doing horseriding at a local school. This allows me to connect with nature and appreciate the beauty of the world we live in.</li>
      </ul>
    <br>
