        I recently decided to start a blog. I figured this would be beneficial for me as it can enable me to see my personal growth, as well as showcase it to you, dear visitor!
        <br>
        I excpect to update this frequently, with posts ranging from altriusm to music competitions. I'll also showcase my growth as a mathematician and physicist. Enjoy :)

    <div class="content"><div class="blog-title"><h3>Mocks over & Half-Term</h3><h6 style="text-align: right;">25/02/2025</h6></div>
    <p>
      At last, half-term!
      Since my last post, I had to undergo many mocks over the last two weeks, some being better than others.
      I haven't received all my results yet, but I know I got 99% in Maths (99% in Numeracy & 100% in Mathematics) and an A* in Physics (woohoo)!
      I do put a lot of time into them, so I am very happy I got good results.
      With that being said, there's always room for improvement.
      Particularly in physics, there are a few questions which caught me by surprise (and on one question I said 10+30=50)!
      Then again, it was great practice and I think it'll make me much more prepared and clear-minded on the day of the real exam in May.
      <br><br>
      Furthermore, I also participated in one of the largest Welsh music competitions for young people, the <a href="https://www.urdd.cymru/en/eisteddfod/">Urdd's Eisteddfod</a>!
      The competition was certainly fierce, but I was still able to perform my piece <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9ditation_(Tha%C3%AFs)">Méditation (Thaïs)</a> to a well enough standard to get 3rd place!
      My certificate and feedback are linked below.
      <br><br>
      Now that it's half-term, I'd like to spend a bit of time working on a few things.
      At least for these first few days, I'd like to take a break from my main school work and focus on super-curricular activities.
      For example, the <a href="https://serenspace.wales/">Seren Academy</a> has offered me the chance to take part in <a href="https://oxplore.org/">Oxplore</a>, an essay competition ran by Oxford University.
      Moreover, I'd like to apply to a summer school and will likely have to spend a large amount of time creating a thorough personal statement.
      <br>
      I am also debating whether I should buy the <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/">Art of Problem Solving</a> books, as I have heard they can give outstanding mathematical intuition and are incredible for preparing for the Olympiads.
      I believe they would be particularly useful to me, especially considering I have the <a href="https://ukmt.org.uk/intermediate-challenges/cayley-hamilton-maclaurin-olympiad-challenge">Hamilton Olympiad</a> coming up…
      <br><br>
      Lastly, I've also taken a keen interest in the world of AI, and would certainly like to learn a bit more about it.
      Hence, I found a <a href="https://deepmindsafetyresearch.medium.com/introducing-our-short-course-on-agi-safety-1072adb7912c">short course into AGI safety</a> by Google DeepMind, which I believe would serve as a nice starting point for me.
      <br>
      Considering the importance of AI in the coming years, I am also looking at the work of organisations such as <a href="https://www.aisi.gov.uk/">AISI</a>, and considering if it's something I'd like to pursue as a career…
      <br><br>
      See you next time!

    <div class="content"><div class="blog-title"><h3>Rejection, Dissapointment, and Finding Resilience</h3><h6 style="text-align: right;">07/02/2025</h6></div>
    <p>
      These last two weeks have been harder than usual.
      <br>
      Last week, I sat the Intermediate Maths Challenge by UKMT. Even though I had done some preparation, the paper was significantly harder this year than in the other years.
      Thus, I did find some questions quite hard.
      I'm not mad about this - there's always things I won't be able to do.
      The problem is I had set myself a target of getting gold this year (every other year I got silver), and there were some questions which I genuinely knew but because of the heat of the moment, I doubted myself and guessed.
      This time I was so close, I knew the answers on some questions and I feel like I robbed myself of a great opportunity.
      <br>
      Additionally, this week I was rejected from a programme which could've greatly benefited my academic progression.
      I put a lot of effort into my application, and I again feel dissapointed.
      <br><br>
      But I now feel I have learnt a valuable lesson, something which I was told when I first came to this country: 'keep calm and carry on.'
      Despite my dissatisfaction with myself, I have learnt that the world keeps spinning, and if I truly have a passion for maths and physics, then I ought to keep going.
      There will be more opportunities like the one I was rejected from, and I can still pay a discretionary fee to sit the <a href="https://ukmt.org.uk/intermediate-challenges/cayley-hamilton-maclaurin-olympiad-challenge">Hamilton Olympiad</a>.
      <br>
      The next two weeks are also going to be difficult, especially considering I have my mocks (and I need to start studying for the Hamilton Olympiad), but with resilience (and prayer), I'll push on!

    <div class="content"><div class="blog-title"><h3>Solar Panel Testing</h3><h6 style="text-align: right;">24/01/2025</h6></div>
        <p>
        This is my first post, how exciting!
        <br>
        Today I had school and my friend bought me a device he wasn't using with solar panels. I brought it home and took everything apart.
        <br>
        I was left with three mini solar panels, which I then put a torch on and tested one of them by connecting a buzzer - it worked! I also was left with a motor, which I was able to take apart and see how physicists used the principle of electromagnetic induction to create motors.
        <br>
        Overall, it was a very informative and insightful day, and I can't wait to see what projects I'll make with my new spare parts...
