        I recently decided to start a blog. I figured this would be beneficial for me as it can enable me to see my personal growth, as well as showcase it to you, dear visitor!
        <br>
        I excpect to update this frequently, with posts ranging from altriusm to music competitions. I'll also showcase my growth as a mathematician and physicist. Enjoy :)
        </p>

    <div class="content"><div class="blog-title"><h3>The Good, the <s>Bad</s> Good and the Ugly</h3><h6 style="text-align: right;">27/04/2025</h6></div>
    <p>
      It's been a very fast month and I didn't get around to updating my blog, but I realised today is the last day of my Easter holidays (oh no), so I better get around to updating this!
      <br><br>
      Firstly, I'm 15 at last (which means I can apply for <a href="https://www.leaf.courses/">Leaf</a>, but more on that later).
      I have to admit that year flew by quite quickly and it's kind of insane to think that I'm 15 now.
      When I was younger, being 15 in my eyes was pretty much synonymous with being an adult - but trust me when I say I do not feel that mature yet!
      I feel like I've done so much but at the same time so little, and overall I'm a bit worried; if a year flies by that quickly, I'll be 18 very soon!
      Even so, my family made sure I enjoyed my birthday, and my general mood has been elevated recently (hooray!).
      <br><br>
      Moving on from the more personal things, I am very happy to say that my <a href="https://oxplore.org/">Oxplore</a> essay was one of two runner ups in the competition!
      I put a lot of effort into it, and I was able to link my fascination of quantum mechanics and uncertainty to the randomness of luck - so I was definitely overjoyed when I heard the news.
      For good measure, I've linked both my essay and certificate below.
      <br><br>
      Additionally, I have also been offered a prize of 5 books from a giant list which they have sent me.
      Particularly, the book <a href="https://academic.oup.com/book/689">Game Theory: A Very Short Introduction</a> has interested me the most because I have recently become captivated by the field of Game theory and Probability.
      From trying to understand things such as Nash Equilibria and Bayes' Theorem, I am becoming more and more engulphed in this intriguing field.
      Hence, I am ecstatic about learning more about it, which leads me onto my next paragraphâ€¦
      Now that I'm 15 years old, I'm finally old enough to apply for a <a href="https://www.leaf.courses/">Leaf</a> course.
      Hopefully from the above, my love for mathematics is quite evident and hence it should come as no surprise that I am applying for the mathematical course.
      Even so I still have enthusiasm and a drive for learning more about the complex field of AI & machine learning (maths in disguise), and hence I would be ecstatic if I got into either course.
      It is very competitive, but I am not too worried about that as even rejected applicants get access to the learning material.
      I'll still try to make a good impression and application however (they might be reading this - hello!), but I am worried that I'll panic under the pressure of the second part of the application (which is more like a test).
      <br><br>
      The reason for this is because I recently took the <a href="https://ukmt.org.uk/intermediate-challenges/cayley-hamilton-maclaurin-olympiad-challenge">Hamilton Olympiad</a>.
      I was in a room, under timed pressure (2 hours), with the task of doing 6 questions.
      I panicked and blundered hard.
      If you go through my previous blog posts, you'll see how much I was looking forward to this, and well - I'm disappointed.
      The questions were great and now, having the solutions at hand, seem very simple.
      But in those 2 hours under pressure, it felt like a mountain.
      The reason I am so disappointed is not because I was unable to do it, but rather the opposite - my answers had the epiphany, they had realised the 'hard' part, but I'd mess up by missing one key fact or multiplying the wrong thing (particularly on questions 1 & 3).
      The Olympiad is marked quite harshly, which means that the few minor blunders could make my marks nosedive.
      Thus, I really don't think I achieved my goal of getting a merit.
      Even so, I have to admit that it certainly did not deter me from mathematics, but it has rather fuelled my drive and I believe this is just a minor setback (keep calm and carry on, they say).
      After all, there's always next year, and with hard work and a bit of luck (which is random) I'm sure I can do it!
      <br><br>
      Also, because of my interests in mathematics, physics and computer science, I felt it would be good for me to also compete in the <a href="https://www.bluequbit.io/quantum-computing-hackathon">BlueQubit Quantum Hackathon</a>.
      I'm a complete beginner to quantum computing so I really didn't do too well (<a href="Files/BlueQubit_Quantum_Hackathon_2025_Leaderboard.png">I came 287th</a>), but quantum computing is a field I might want to pursue a career in so experience is always welcome!
      <br><br>
      Moreover, I've been trying to find work experience for physics and mathematics.
      Writing a research paper seems to be challenging and perhaps overly ambitious (although I'm still trying and don't plan to stop), so I am looking for other things I could do.
      I have recently come in contact with <a href="https://bute.energy/">Bute Energy</a>, and they're very kindly offering me work experience in the summer, where I'll get a much better understanding of what it's like working on some of the world's most pressing problems - such as fighting against climate change through renewable energy.
      <br><br>
      Lastly, I also got accepted into <a href="https://electricsheep.teachable.com/">Electric Sheep's Futurekind AI Fellowship</a>, suggested to me by <a href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/">Effective Altruism</a>.
      This will be a completely new experience for me, I'll tell you more soon!
      <br><br>
      I also had my Welsh & Greek GCSE speaking exams which I had to prepare and revise for.
      I think they went well, although I did make some very simple mistakes which I can't get off my mind.
      I have more GCSEs coming up (from 21st of May - 19th of June) which I have to revise for, so I might slow down on a few of the things I'm doing.
      Don't worry though, I'll catch up when it's all over.
      See you next time!

    <div class="content"><div class="blog-title"><h3>A Busy Fortnight</h3><h6 style="text-align: right;">12/03/2025</h6></div>
    <p>
      It's been two weeks since my last blog post, so I thought I'd write about what has happened.
      <br><br>
      Firstly, I took the <a href="https://www.internationalresearcholympiad.org/">International Research Olmypiad</a>.
      It consisted of four papers in different fields and tested critical thinking, time management and overall analysis of research.
      I must say, it was quite challenging so I didn't get through to the semi-finals, but I'm still quite happy I did it as it was a great learning opportunity and has gotten my very interested in doing my own researchâ€¦
      Additionally, if and when I get my certificate, I'll be sure to link it either below and/or in <a href="portfolio.html">my portfolio</a>.
      <br><br>
      Secondly, unfortunately I got rejected from <a href="https://www.non-trivial.org/">Non-Trivial</a>.
      I was quite disappointed, but it inspired me to take initiative and email my local university asking for research opportunities (how exciting).
      Plus, I can always try again in the future.
      I put a lot of effort into my application however, and I still feel its worth publishing my answers to the brainteasers with my thought process behind them. I've thus linked them below.
      <br><br>
      I'm also going to be 15 soon, and I'll finally be able to apply for <a href="https://www.leaf.courses/">Leaf</a>.
      The good thing is that even if I don't get accepted, they still give rejected students access to the resources - so I can still fuel my learning during the summer!
      <br><br>
      Moreover, I finished my <a href="https://oxplore.org/">Oxplore</a> essay regarding the question 'Do you make your own luck?'
      It was certainly very interesting, making me link the quantum mechanics and philosophical arguments together.
      I feel I may have talked a bit too much about physics, but hopefully that shows my passion and doesn't just appear as academic jargon.
      I've linked the essay below for anyone interested.
      <br><br>
      Furthermore, I now have my hands on both volumes of the <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/">Art of Problem Solving</a> books.
      I've only been able to read the first couple of pages so far but I had a skim through both of the books and I think they're going to be very beneficial reads, especially considering that I've talked to my school and I'm now set to do the <a href="https://ukmt.org.uk/intermediate-challenges/cayley-hamilton-maclaurin-olympiad-challenge">Hamilton Olympiad</a>â€¦
      <br><br>
      I also applied to one of <a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/be-inspired/schools-outreach/secondary-schools/summer-schools/insights-into-stem/">Imperial College London's Year 10 Science Summer Residentials</a>.
      Again, I'd absolutely love to get in as it would showcase my passion for physics and maths whilst allowing me to get-in-touch with like-minded people.
      Even so, over the past few months I have become more comfortable with rejection, so even if things don't turn out I'll just keep pushing!
      <br><br>
      Lastly, I've been cold emailing a few people, joining communities and doing a lot more research about my future.
      I am still uncertain as ever, but I am beginning to consider different careers I can pursue with a mathematics and physics degree.
      Primarily I would like to do groundbreaking research to make a change and solve one of the world's leading problems, but alternatively I could go into medicine or quantitative finance.
      <br>
      I want to make a difference now, so I'm constantly meeting and emailing different people so I can help and do my part.
      If you would like to get in contact, please don't hesistate to contact me at <a href="mailto:opportunities@manolidis.me">this email</a>.
      <br>
      We'll see how things turn out but in the meantime, I can continue trying my best and hope for the best.
      After all, if I truely love what I do (which I do) then no amount of rejection can stop me!

    <div class="content"><div class="blog-title"><h3>Mocks Over & Half-Term</h3><h6 style="text-align: right;">25/02/2025</h6></div>
    <p>
      At last, half-term!
      Since my last post, I had to undergo many mocks over the last two weeks, some being better than others.
      I haven't received all my results yet, but I know I got 99% in Maths (99% in Numeracy & 100% in Mathematics) and an A* in Physics (woohoo)!
      I do put a lot of time into them, so I am very happy I got good results.
      With that being said, there's always room for improvement.
      Particularly in physics, there are a few questions which caught me by surprise (and on one question I said 10+30=50)!
      Then again, it was great practice and I think it'll make me much more prepared and clear-minded on the day of the real exam in May.
      <br><br>
      Furthermore, I also participated in one of the largest Welsh music competitions for young people, the <a href="https://www.urdd.cymru/en/eisteddfod/">Urdd's Eisteddfod</a>!
      The competition was certainly fierce, but I was still able to perform my piece <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9ditation_(Tha%C3%AFs)">MÃ©ditation (ThaÃ¯s)</a> to a well enough standard to get 3rd place!
      My certificate and feedback are linked below.
      <br><br>
      Now that it's half-term, I'd like to spend a bit of time working on a few things.
      At least for these first few days, I'd like to take a break from my main school work and focus on super-curricular activities.
      For example, the <a href="https://serenspace.wales/">Seren Academy</a> has offered me the chance to take part in <a href="https://oxplore.org/">Oxplore</a>, an essay competition ran by Oxford University.
      Moreover, I'd like to apply to a summer school and will likely have to spend a large amount of time creating a thorough personal statement.
      <br>
      I am also debating whether I should buy the <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/">Art of Problem Solving</a> books, as I have heard they can give outstanding mathematical intuition and are incredible for preparing for the Olympiads.
      I believe they would be particularly useful to me, especially considering I have the <a href="https://ukmt.org.uk/intermediate-challenges/cayley-hamilton-maclaurin-olympiad-challenge">Hamilton Olympiad</a> coming upâ€¦
      <br><br>
      Lastly, I've also taken a keen interest in the world of AI, and would certainly like to learn a bit more about it.
      Hence, I found a <a href="https://deepmindsafetyresearch.medium.com/introducing-our-short-course-on-agi-safety-1072adb7912c">short course into AGI safety</a> by Google DeepMind, which I believe would serve as a nice starting point for me.
      <br>
      Considering the importance of AI in the coming years, I am also looking at the work of organisations such as <a href="https://www.aisi.gov.uk/">AISI</a>, and considering if it's something I'd like to pursue as a careerâ€¦
      <br><br>
      See you next time!

    <p>
      These last two weeks have been harder than usual.
      <br>
      Last week, I sat the Intermediate Maths Challenge by UKMT. Even though I had done some preparation, the paper was significantly harder this year than in the other years.
      Thus, I did find some questions quite hard.
      I'm not mad about this - there's always things I won't be able to do.
      The problem is I had set myself a target of getting gold this year (every other year I got silver), and there were some questions which I genuinely knew but because of the heat of the moment, I doubted myself and guessed.
      This time I was so close, I knew the answers on some questions and I feel like I robbed myself of a great opportunity.
      <br>
      Additionally, this week I was rejected from a programme which could've greatly benefited my academic progression.
      I put a lot of effort into my application, and I again feel dissapointed.
      <br><br>
      But I now feel I have learnt a valuable lesson, something which I was told when I first came to this country: 'keep calm and carry on.'
      Despite my dissatisfaction with myself, I have learnt that the world keeps spinning, and if I truly have a passion for maths and physics, then I ought to keep going.
      There will be more opportunities like the one I was rejected from, and I can still pay a discretionary fee to sit the <a href="https://ukmt.org.uk/intermediate-challenges/cayley-hamilton-maclaurin-olympiad-challenge">Hamilton Olympiad</a>.
      <br>
      The next two weeks are also going to be difficult, especially considering I have my mocks (and I need to start studying for the Hamilton Olympiad), but with resilience (and prayer), I'll push on!

        <p>
        This is my first post, how exciting!
        <br>
        Today I had school and my friend bought me a device he wasn't using with solar panels. I brought it home and took everything apart.
        <br>
        I was left with three mini solar panels, which I then put a torch on and tested one of them by connecting a buzzer - it worked! I also was left with a motor, which I was able to take apart and see how physicists used the principle of electromagnetic induction to create motors.
        <br>
        Overall, it was a very informative and insightful day, and I can't wait to see what projects I'll make with my new spare parts...
